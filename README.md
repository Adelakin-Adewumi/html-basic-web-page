HARRY POTTER

It works based on background detection and colour detection. You can adjust the colours of the cloak by changing the H values of the lower and upper red limits. In this code we have taken red coloured cloak so the value is from 10-170. For the colour codes or the HSV values of green and blue colours refer the web. Green starts from 120-180. You can adjust the saturation and brightness values by changing the S and V values. First show the webcam towards the background as it is the mask1 of the code and then show the cloak as it the mask 2 of the code. The code is basically the superimposition of the 2 images.
